# Parallel-String-Matching
<!-- ![screenshot](ProjectDescription.png) -->

## Background
Grep is a linux command that is used to find patterns in each file. It prints each line that matches the pattern. In this project you will be implementing “Parallel string matching” that will search for a string in all files and subdirectories of a root directory using multiple processes.
